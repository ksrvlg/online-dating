            <h2 class="section-title">Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Meaningful Connections was created for people who value integrity and are searching for lasting relationships. We understand that online dating can feel uncertain, which is why we’ve built a community centred on respect, authenticity and safety.</p>
            <p>Unlike platforms that promote casual or adult dating, our focus is on helping people find genuine partners. Taboola’s advertising rules prohibit promoting adult or casual dating sites【229973747648658†L84-L96】, so we have consciously built our service to foster meaningful relationships and discourage sexualised interactions.</p>
            <h2 class="section-title">What Sets Us Apart?</h2>
            <ul style="list-style: disc;padding-left:1.5rem;font-size:1rem;">
                <li><strong>Respect and Safety:</strong> All members must be at least 18 years old and agree to our content standards. We do not allow pornographic, sexualised or shocking material on profiles or messages【229973747648658†L84-L96】【843280175682334†L61-L63】.</li>
                <li><strong>Diversity and Inclusion:</strong> We welcome members from all backgrounds and do not tolerate hate, discrimination or abusive behaviour. Taboola’s policies expressly forbid campaigns that discriminate or disparage protected classes【229973747648658†L119-L134】.</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> We clearly outline our policies and provide contact details on every page. Our team monitors profiles to ensure compliance with advertising and community standards.</li>
                <li><strong>Focused on Connection:</strong> Our features are designed to help you discover people with shared values and goals, not to encourage casual encounters.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="section-title">Advertising Compliance</h2>
            <p>Because we may promote our service through native advertising networks like Taboola, our landing pages and advertisements adhere to strict guidelines. This means no misleading thumbnails or titles, no sexualised images, and no exaggerated claims【268185352425025†L77-L123】. All images are high-quality and relevant to the content, and we provide clear disclosures where required.</p>
